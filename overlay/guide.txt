Once a match has been started it will call a function that initialises the overlay .txt files
once that is done you can use them in OBS.

To use a .txt in OBS:

    In your scene, right click and select add > text in the sources table
    Name it something helpful (eg Players Team One, Timer, Score Team Two)
    Select 'Use Text From File' and browse to wear the overlay txt files are located
    Choose Consolas or any other monospaced font (this will make the names line up)
