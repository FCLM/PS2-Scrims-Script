# PS2 Scrims Script

_Make sure you have the latest [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed (This application requires at least Node 7.6.0 to run)_

**N.B: If you don't know computers then use _install.bat_ followed by _start.bat_ to install and start the script**

You will need to create 2 javascript files, api_key.js and password.js. 
There are templates of both to show you what they should look like.

To run the script, navigate to the folder where the script is now located using command line.

```sh
$ npm install
```

Once this finishes downloading the dependencies you can run the script using:

```sh
$ node bin/www
```

Then navigate to localhost:3010/admin from there you can control the script as long as you have the password set correctly.
