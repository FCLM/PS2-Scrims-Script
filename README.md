# PS2 Scrims Script

Make sure you have the latest [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed 

You will need to create 2 javascript files, api_key.js and password.js. 
There are templates of both to show you what they should look like.

To run the script, navigate to the folder where the script is now located.

```sh
$ npm install
```

Once this finishes downloading the dependencies you can run the script using:

```sh
$ node bin/www
```

Once this is done, navigate to localhost:3001/admin
From there you can control the script as long as you have the password set correctly.
